        <h1>Control of the AC Motor Drive</h1>
        
        <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>Work  of  the  three-phase  alternating  current  (AC)  induction  motor  is  simulated  by  ACMotor user control.
        Its essential part is a three - phase asynchronous squirrel - cage rotor, widely applied to high - 
        power drives. The task of this laboratory exercise is to write a PLC program that should perform the 
        functions presented below.</p>
 
        <h3>Start the motor with the Y-connection</h3>
        <p>Pressing the SR button (Start Right) or SL button (Start Left) activates the coil K3 (Y-connection).
        After about 0.2s the coils K1 or K2 are activated according to the chosen direction of rotation (right or left).</p>
 
        <h3>Switching to the ∆ -connection</h3>
        <p>After about 3s of working with the Y-connection, the motor reaches the proper rotation speed to be 
        switched over  to  the ∆-connection. The K3  is off, and 0.2s  later  the K4  is switched on. This delay 
        protects the motor against the short-circuit and welding of conductors.</p>
 
        <h3>Stop the motor</h3>
        <p>The motor  is  stopped after pressing  the ST (STop) button. The PLC program  switches off all the 
        coils at the very moment.</p>
 
        <h3>Change of the direction</h3>
        <p>To change  the direction of  the AC motor’s rotation, any two mains cables have to be changed.
        On the panel, it is performed  by  switching-over  the  coils K1  and K2.  The  direction  of  the motor’s 
        rotation may  be  changed  only  by  switching  from Y  to  delta  connection. Hence,  a  change  of  the 
        direction must be preceded by pressing the ST button.</p>
 
        <h3>Overload</h3>
        <p>Pressing  the overload button  implies a simulation of an additional braking  torque, what causes  the 
        overload of the motor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In  the  case  when  the  motor  is  working  with  the  Y-connection,  pressing  the  overload  button 
            implies an instantaneous motor disconnection from the mains. </li>
            <li>In the case when the motor is working with the ∆-connection, short overloads (up to 3s) are 
            ignored, but long overloads (over 3s) cause that the motor must be stopped (all the coils off).</li>
            <li>Restart of the motor is available only after pressing the ST button.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Preservations and interlocks</h3>
        <p>Considering the security requirements, the PLC program should contain the following preservations 
        and interlocks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outputs  of  the  PLC  that  control  the K1 -  K4  relays  block  each  other,  i.e. Q1  blocks Q2, Q3 
            blocks Q4 and vice versa.</li>
            <li>Signals I5 - I8 that confirm the state of the coils are used for supervising the work of the drive.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Left and right limit switch</h3>
        <p>The  program 
        should meet the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Appearing the Right limit switch signal while  the motor  is  rotating  right means  that  the  drive should 
            be stopped.</li>
            <li>Now it is possible to start the drive to the opposite (left) direction by 
                pressing the SL button.</li>
            <li>The motor rotates left until the left limit position is achieved. This stops 
            the motor.</li>
            <li>Now it is possible to start the drive to the opposite (right) direction by 
                pressing the SR button.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>LIST OF VARIABLES</h2>
        <p>The  inputs  of  the  PLC  are  the  outputs  of  the  panel. They  inform  the  PLC  about  the  state  of  an 
        electric motor (contacts) and operator’s orders (push - buttons). A list of inputs used in this exercise 
        is presented in a table below. </p>
